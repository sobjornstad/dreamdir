For ddir publication:
* README/docs (some is now online)
* getDreamsTagged I think is broken if ‘Id’ isn’t the first header -- fix
* Tests? (https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)
* Move dreamdir development into a separate folder, separate from my own dream content, and split off/sanitize the git repo.
* Have a think about command naming, as this will be much harder to change once I publish anything.

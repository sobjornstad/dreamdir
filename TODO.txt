* getDreamsTagged might be broken if ‘Id’ isn’t the first header -- fix
* More work on tests
* An option to sort/uniq ORed-together conditions, or not
* get-header should probably not skip dreams that don’t match at all?
* Protect against user using @ (system reserved character) somewhere in command line
* Do a better job of parsing optional args to actions (not search-exprs)
* Make the Python library itself use the C implementation of word count if
  possible. Or something -- the different ways to invoke word counts and get a
  response are an awful mess. The word-count ‘dr’ function should accept the
  arguments that ‘drwc’ can take, too.
* Tag blacklists
* Plugins (by searching a plugins directory for action name script?).

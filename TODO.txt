For ddir publication:
* README/docs
* Reconsider which headers are automatic -- may be easier to delete than add
* getDreamsTagged I think is broken if ‘Id’ isn’t the first header -- fix
* Don’t require a fixed DREAMDIR value in ddirparse, that’s bad
* ‘dr when’ command to find the date of a dream
* and maybe a similar action for printing all headers to stdout, or the values of certain headers

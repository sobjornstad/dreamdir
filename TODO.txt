For ddir publication:
* README/docs
* getDreamsTagged I think is broken if ‘Id’ isn’t the first header -- fix
* ‘dr when’ command to find the date of a dream
* and maybe a similar action for printing all headers to stdout, or the values of certain headers
* dump-headers?
* improve cat to allow selection of only specific dreams?
* Move dreamdir development into a separate folder, separate from my own dream content, and split off/sanitize the git repo.

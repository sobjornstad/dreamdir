Changes in 1.0.1
----------------

Bugfixes:

* Fix a bug where '.' was not correctly handled in search regexes.
* Add a blank line at the end of the headers when creating a new dream; not
  doing so was an accidental regression.
* Fix a problem where options set by the vim plugin only applied to the first
  buffer if multiple files were loaded.
* Display the average words/day, not the average words/dream, as the "average"
  in the statistics table.

New features:

* Add a new script to help with adding titles to dreams that don't have them.
* Implement word count feature in C, and add a front-end in `dr`.
* Write some tests for the `dr` script; more to come.

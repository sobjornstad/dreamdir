Changes in 1.0.2
----------------

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Bugfixes:

* Add an ftdetect file so the vim plugin actually loads on .dre files out of
  the box.
* Remove dependency on a script on my local machine that wasn't included in the
  distribution.
* The formatting of 'dr find' is no longer messed up if dreams with ID numbers
  greater than 9999 are included in the output.
* Search expression options -vrsl are now applied in a consistent and documented
  order.
* Dream files are now pulled with the glob '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].dre'
  rather than '*.dre', so other .dre files in the directory that are not dreams
  (for instance, temporary files that you wanted syntax highlighting to work on)
  will not confuse the search functions.
* Fix tests several times, and add a pre-commit hook that can be set to run
  tests before committing.
* Fix RegeneratePlots.sh getting very confused when the scripts/ directory in a
  dreamdir is a symlink.

New features:

* Add a -f option for 'dr cat' that folds lines at 80 characters, trying to do
  so at word boundaries (using 'fold -s').
* Print word counts for each individual dream, not just the total (and add an
  option that prints only the total).


Changes in 1.0.1
----------------

Bugfixes:

* Fix a bug where '.' was not correctly handled in search regexes.
* Add a blank line at the end of the headers when creating a new dream; not
  doing so was an accidental regression.
* Fix a problem where options set by the vim plugin only applied to the first
  buffer if multiple files were loaded.
* Display the average words/day, not the average words/dream, as the "average"
  in the statistics table.

New features:

* Add a new script to help with adding titles to dreams that don't have them.
* Implement word count feature in C, and add a front-end in `dr`.
* Write some tests for the `dr` script; more to come.
